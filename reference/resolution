# Xclips.ai Codebase Resolution Log

## Initial Review Findings

### 1. Package and Dependency Issues
- **Backend (`apps/api/package.json`)** and **Frontend (`apps/web/package.json`)** reference local packages (`@xclips/db`, `@xclips/config`, `@xclips/ui`). Ensure these are built and linked correctly, or errors will occur at runtime.
- All referenced dependencies in both package.json files appear to be present, but cross-package linking (monorepo) must be verified.

### 2. TypeScript Configurations
- Both frontend and backend extend the root `tsconfig.json`. No immediate issues, but ensure all paths and typeRoots are correct and that all referenced types exist.

### 3. API/Backend Issues
- `apps/api/src/router/auth.ts` is empty, but is imported and used in `src/index.ts`. This will cause runtime errors (cannot use an empty router). **Resolution needed: Implement or remove this router.**
- `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts` uses a different import path for `prisma` than other files (`../../../../packages/db/client`). This may cause issues if the path is incorrect or the file does not exist.
- All other routers and routes appear to be implemented and imported correctly.

### 4. Frontend Issues
- Many components import from `@xclips/ui`, which must be built and available in `node_modules` or via workspace linking. If not, imports will fail.
- `CreditMeter` is implemented in both `apps/web/components/credit-meter.tsx` and `packages/ui/src/components/CreditMeter.tsx`. This may cause confusion or duplicate usage. **Resolution: Standardize on one implementation.**
- All frontend pages and components appear to be implemented and imported correctly, assuming all packages are built and linked.

### 5. Environment Variables
- Many files depend on environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, etc.). Missing or misconfigured env vars will cause runtime errors.

### 6. General Recommendations
- Ensure all local packages are built and linked before running the app.
- Remove or implement empty/placeholder files (e.g., `auth.ts`).
- Standardize component usage to avoid confusion (e.g., `CreditMeter`).
- Double-check all import paths, especially for monorepo local packages.
- Ensure all required environment variables are set in `.env` files for both frontend and backend.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue reviewing for deeper issues, including runtime logic, API contract mismatches, and further package reference errors.
- Begin applying fixes and logging each change here.
